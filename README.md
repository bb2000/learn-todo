# Code Club TODO Application

## What is it?

This is a web application dedicated to helping you organize all the tasks you have to do so you never forget a task or miss a due date again.
The application was made in HTML and Javascript using [mithril.js](http://mithril.js.org).

## How to get it?

To run the application, simply clone the repo and open index.html.
In the future there will be a hosted version of this application online and instructions on how to host it yourself.
